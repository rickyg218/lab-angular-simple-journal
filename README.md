# Angular 2 & Express API | Simple Journal

## Introduction

![](images/journal.jpg)


Quite a few people keep a journal, as there are [many benefits to doing so](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-health-benefits-of-journaling/), including better self awareness, stress relief, and increased problem solving capabilities.

Pen and paper can be great, but we're here to learn web development.

In doing so, we're going to create a personal journal using Angular 2, and an Express API.

## Requirements

- [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- Include both the client and server applications in your submission.

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

```
git add .
git commit -m "done"
git push origin master
```

- Navigate to your repo and [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

## Exercise

### Iteration 1 | Setup

We've created a seedfile in `bin/seeds.js`, run the seedfile to save the journal entries to the database.

This route should be located at `/api/journal-entries`, and should response with a JSON array of objects of all journal entries in the database.

### Iteration 2 | Listing Entries

Create an Angular *service* to retrieve journal entries from your API. The endpoint is located at GET `/api/journal-entries`.

Create an `entry-list` component which uses this service and find and display a list of your entries upon loading, with only the `title` and `date`.

Add the Angular router to your application. Create the home route which will make use of your `entry-list` component.

### Iteration 3 | Single Entry

Add a method to your `journal-entries` service to retrieve a single journal entry. The single journal entry endpoint is located at `/api/journal-entries/:id`

Create a `single-entry` component which finds a single entry from the API by it's ID, and displays the `title`, `date`, and `content`.

Finally, add a route to your Angular router, `/:id` which will render your single-entry component.

### Bonus | Creating Entries

Add a new method to your  that takes in an object containing a `title` and `content`, and makes a POST request to `/api/journal-entries`.

Create an `entry-form-component` and display it on the home page with the list of all of your journal entries. Optionally, add a button to show and hide the form.

Upon submission of this form, use your `journal-entries` service to make a POST request to the API and create the new entry.

Upon success of this submission, make sure the new journal entry is displayed on the home page.
